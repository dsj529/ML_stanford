Coding exercises for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course from Stanford University, taken via Coursera.com

Code written in Octave 4.2.1

* Week 1: Implementation of Linear Regression, with parameters learned via Gradient Descent and Normal Equation solutions.  Implementations for both single and multiple variable regressions.

* Week 2: Implementation of Logistic Regression, using Gradient Descent to learn parameters.  Also contains implementation of regularized parameter learning.

* Week 3: Implementation of multiclass (one-vs-all) Logistic Regression.  Implementation of forward-feed Neural Network.
